# hat-sharing

Permalink: <https://aka.ms/hat-sharing>.

As a dev crew in [Microsoft CSE (Commercial Software Engineering)](https://github.com/microsoft/code-with-engineering-playbook/blob/master/CSE.md),
we coded with a customer for a project (let's call it `hat`) that involved DevOps, DataOps and MLOps.

We are sharing things that could help bootstrap similar projects.

The codename of the engagement started with "hat". In these publications, we call it the **hat** engagement.

Here are some links to these sharing artifacts:
